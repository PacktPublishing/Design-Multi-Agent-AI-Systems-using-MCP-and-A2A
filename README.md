Frustrated by opaque agent frameworks that hide how things work? This book gives you complete control by guiding you through building a fully functional, extensible agentic AI framework in Python without relying on external orchestration tools.
You’ll begin by implementing a simple tool-using agent, and then gradually extend its capabilities with structured tool schemas, user interfaces, and memory via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). From there, you’ll build collaborative multi-agent systems powered by Agent-to-Agent (A2A) messaging and deploy them in realistic environments. Along the way, you’ll explore secure tool invocation, message routing, observability, and human-in-the-loop workflows.
With annotated code, deep engineering insights, and practical deployment patterns, this hands-on guide equips you to build AI agents that reason, plan, act, and adapt, whether you’re shipping production systems or experimenting with cutting-edge LLM-based architectures.
Written by Gigi Sayfan, who builds AI agent infrastructure at Perplexity and is a bestselling author with decades of experience in AI and distributed systems, this book gives you the tools and knowledge to engineer your own advanced agentic systems.

## Software and Hardware Requirements

### Prerequisites
Before getting started, you should have:
- A basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts
- A basic understanding of large language models (LLMs)

### Supported Operating Systems
The examples in this book can be run on:
- Windows  
- macOS  
- Linux

### Required Software

| Software          | Version / Requirement | Supported OS            |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Python            | Python 3.x             | Windows, macOS, Linux   |
| OpenAI API Key    | Required for examples  | Windows, macOS, Linux   |

You will need access to a Python development environment.  
An OpenAI API key is required for many of the examples in the book.

### Recommended Hardware
- A machine with at least **8 GB of RAM** is recommended for running more complex examples.

### Additional Notes
If you are using the digital version of this book, we recommend typing the code manually or accessing it directly from the book’s GitHub repository (link provided in the next section).  
This helps avoid errors that may occur from copying and pasting code.
